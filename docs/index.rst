The workflow-api is a sub-component of the LabCas-workflow module which is described in detail in the `LabCas-workflows documentation <https://jpl-labcas.github.io/workflows/>`_. It provides a RESTful API to interact with the LabCas workflows engine and review/edit the produced data before registration and publication.
